# Cats-vs-Dogs-Image-Classification-with-Data-Augmentation
This repository contains a notebook that trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats vs dogs, with a strong focus on data augmentation to improve generalization and robustness.  The project is ideal as a deep learning starter project and a portfolio piece for computer vision and Keras/TensorFlow skills.
